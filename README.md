#### Step 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- The code starts by clearing the MATLAB workspace to ensure a clean environment.
- Meteorological data from the "metro_Denmark.csv" file is read into MATLAB using the `readtable` function and stored in the variable `metoData`.

```matlab
clear;
metoData = readtable("metro_Denmark.csv");
```

#### Step 2: Heat Demand Calculation
- Parameters such as house area, window surface area, old and new heating capacities, internal temperature, and solar heat gain coefficient are defined.
- Heat demand is calculated before and after modernization based on thermal losses and solar gain for both old and new heating systems.

```matlab
HouseArea = 225;
WindowsSArea = 36;
H_old = 440;
H_new = 160;
T_internal = 22; 
SHGC = 0.25;

% Calculating heat demand before modernization
Q_extra = 611.67; %[W]
Q_losses_old = H_old*(metoData.T2m - T_internal); 
Q_solar = WindowsSArea*SHGC*metoData.G_i_; 
Q_gain = Q_solar + Q_extra;
Heat.Q_old = Q_gain + Q_losses_old;

% Calculating heat demand after modernization
Q_losses_new = H_new*(metoData.T2m - T_internal);
Heat.Q_net_new = Q_gain + Q_losses_new;
```

#### Step 3: Comparison of Heating Systems
- The energy demand for the gas boiler before modernization is calculated based on its efficiency and converted to gas usage.
- The performance data of the heat pump, including COP and power consumption at different outdoor temperatures, is provided.
- The total power consumption and heat generation of the heat pump are computed.

```matlab
% Gas Boiler before modernization
Eff_GasBoiler = 0.95;
Q_GB = Q_demand_old / 0.95; %[W]
Total_Q_GB = sum(Q_GB);
ConversionRatio = 10.55; % 1m^3 = 10.55kWh for natural gas
GasUsage = abs(Total_Q_demand_old/Eff_GasBoiler/ConversionRatio); %[m^3] 

% Heat Pump after modernization
COP = [4.17, 3.26, 2.54, 4.81, 3.7, 2.85, 5.59, 4.23, 3.26]';
Power = [2.16, 2.61, 3.28, 2.16, 2.67, 3.32, 2.13, 2.68, 3.32]';
T = [-5, 35; -5, 45; -5, 55; 0, 35; 0, 45; 0, 55; 5, 35; 5, 45; 5, 55;];

heatPump = HPfinal(COP,Power,T);

[Q_HP, Power_HP, COP_cal] = heatPump.calculateHeat(35,metoData.T2m);

Total_Power_HP = sum(Power_HP); %[kW]
Total_Q_HP = sum(Q_HP); %[kW]
```

#### Step 4: Visualization and Analysis
- The results are visualized through plots comparing power demand and supply for both old and new heating systems.
- The contribution of renewable sources, specifically wind turbines, is evaluated.
- The net generation from wind turbines and the overall electricity demand with and without the heat pump are analyzed.

```matlab
% Visualization and Analysis
figure
plot (abs(Q_demand_old)/10^3, 'DisplayName', 'Q demand old');
hold on
plot (abs(Q_GB)/10^3, 'DisplayName', 'Q supply');
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Power demand and supply');
title('Comparison of Power demand (old) and supply (kW)');
legend('show');

figure
plot (abs(Q_demand_new)/10^3, 'DisplayName', 'Q demand new');
hold on
plot (abs(Q_HP), 'DisplayName', 'Q supply');
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Power demand and supply');
title('Comparison of Power demand (new) and supply (kW)');
legend('show');
```

#### Step 5: Wind Turbine Integration:
- A wind turbine object is initialized with specified parameters.
- Wind speed data is used to calculate the power generated by the turbine.
- The total turbine power is computed based on the number of turbines installed.

```matlab
% Wind Turbine Properties
Turbine1 = windTurbine(3.2, 11, 25, 3.5); %[kW]
N_Turbines = 1; 
metoData = readtable("metro_Denmark.csv");
RESSources = metoData(:,["Y" "M" "D" "H"]);
RESSources.Turbine = N_Turbines*Turbine1.calculatePower(metoData.WS10m); %[kW]
```

#### Step 6: Electricity Analysis:
- Electricity demand without the heat pump and with the heat pump is determined.
- The for loop iterates through each hour of the data in the `RESSources` table and determines the flow of electricity to and from the grid based on the net generation values for each hour. 
- If the net generation is negative, indicating a deficit, electricity is drawn from the grid to meet the demand. If the net generation is non-negative, surplus electricity is fed back into the grid.

```matlab
% Electrical Demand
ElectricalPower = metoData(:,["Y" "M" "D" "H" "ElectricPower_kW_"]); %[kW]
E_demand_withoutHP = ElectricalPower.ElectricPower_kW_; %[kW]
E_demand_withHP = E_demand_withoutHP + abs(Power_HP);

% Net Genration
RESSources.NettGeneration =  RESSources.Turbine - E_demand_withHP;
for hourIterator = 1:height(RESSources) 
    if RESSources.NettGeneration(hourIterator) < 0 
        RESSources.FromGrid(hourIterator) = RESSources.NettGeneration(hourIterator);
        RESSources.ToGrid(hourIterator) = 0;
    else
        RESSources.FromGrid(hourIterator) = 0; 
        RESSources.ToGrid(hourIterator) = RESSources.NettGeneration(hourIterator);
    end
end
```

#### Step 7: Economic Assessment
- An economic analysis is conducted to assess the investment required for modernization and potential savings.
- Costs associated with electricity and gas consumption before and after modernization are compared.
- Revenue generated from selling excess electricity to the grid is considered.
- The payback period, indicating the time required to recover the investment, is calculated based on the net gain from energy savings and revenue.

```matlab
% Economic Assessment
Invest_Turbine = 10115 * N_Turbines; %dollar
Invest_HP = 5500;
Invest_Redesign = 4000;

% Electricity and Gas price
PriceDemand_Elec = 0.42;
PriceDemand_Gas = 2.1;
PriceSupply_Elec = 0.9; 

% Calculating Costs and Savings
Cost_Elec_Before = sum(E_demand_withoutHP)*PriceDemand_Elec;
Cost_Elec_After = sum(RESSources.FromGrid)*PriceDemand_Elec;

Saving_Elec = Cost_Elec_Before - Cost_Elec_After;
Saving_Gas = GasUsage*PriceDemand_Gas;

Sell_Elec = sum(RESSources.ToGrid)*PriceSupply_Elec;

NetGain = Saving_Gas + Saving_Elec + Sell_Elec;

% Calculating Payback Period
PayBackPeriod = TotalInvest/NetGain;
if PayBackPeriod <1
    PayBackPeriod = 1;   
else 
    PayBackPeriod = ceil(PayBackPeriod);
end

fprintf("Pay-back Period, %d years\n", PayBackPeriod);
```
